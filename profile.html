            Charles Leclerc frustrated with Ferrari strategy in Qualifying for Canadian Grand Prix after Q2 exit
            Charles Leclerc failed to reach Q3 for the second consecutive F1 race after a strategy error from Ferrari and the Monegasque driver not being able to go fast enough on the intermediates tyres; watch the Canadian GP with build-up at 5.30pm and lights out at 7pm on SundayCharles Leclerc says Ferrari are "not making our life any easier" after his Q2 exit at the Canadian Grand Prix.
            Leclerc will start 10th for Sunday's race in Montreal after Ferrari went against his call to use dry tyres at the start of Q2 when the track was at its driest.
            
            Other drivers completed laps on the soft tyres to secure a place in Q3, while Leclerc's best lap came on the intermediates as he switched to the dry tyres as rain began to fall heavily again.
            
            Leclerc had called to follow Alex Albon, who was the first driver to use slicks and topped the timesheet in Q2, but Ferrari wanted the Monegasque driver to complete a banker lap on the intermediates first.
            "When the track is so dry and we are staying on intermediates, we are not making our life any easier," Leclerc told Sky Sports F1.
            "We will discuss with the team but it's not the first time it's happened. We are quite often on the wrong side of making those decisions in those tricky situations.
            "I had a clear opinion and we went for something opposite. Obviously it's frustrating to accept it first, then you are putting yourself in a very difficult situation.
            
            "From that moment onwards, it slipped away from us. Having said that, it's not all of that because other drivers managed to go to Q3 in the same way I did. Again, we are just making our life way too difficult.
            "I will manage it myself internally and I don't want to say what will happen but there will be a talk and analysis. Hopefully we can come back stronger from it because it's been quite a few times now."
            Leclerc's difficult season continues
            Since taking pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April, Leclerc has not had a clean Qualifying.
            In Monaco, he was given a three-grid place penalty for impeding Lando Norris in Q3. In Spain, Leclerc struggled with the balance of his car in drying conditions, so was eliminated in Q1 and his latest setback in Canada came down to strategy.
            After Ferrari's 2022 title challenge faded due to a run of strategy and reliability issues in the summer, Leclerc was hoping to be in the championship hunt this season.
            However, tyre wear, balance issues, mistakes from the team and errors from Leclerc himself have caused lots of frustration at Ferrari.
            Sky Sports F1's Danica Patrick said: "That has been the story. It's part of their issues that they have to be organised and get in sync. They just have to be on the same page then they can get into trusting each other to make those good calls. You can definitely sense that frustration.
            "Even at Mercedes, you have seen, as the struggles crop up, when it persists long enough, you see it come out. Normally, within a team you are very supportive but you do always reach a boiling point and we are seeing that spilling over here and there, rightfully so because there is a lot of pressure.
            Leclerc initially hit out at ferrari after getting knocked out of Q2 in Montreal when he and the team had failed to capitalise on improving track conditions.
            He had initially ventured out at the start of the session on intermediate tyres but, with a dry line emerging, he requested an immediate change to slicks.
            The team denied that and ordered him to put a banker lap in before he changed tyres.

            However, by the time he came back out, the rain had returned, and Leclerc was unable to put in a time good enough to make the final Q3 shootout.
            Speaking straight after qualifying, Leclerc felt the delay in going to slicks was a mistake as he said that Ferrari needed to stop making such errors.
            "I think we are just making our life way too difficult," he told the media. "In those situations, I had a clear opinion. And yeah, we decided to do something else. So, I am frustrated."
            He added: "We have to be better than that. And we cannot afford to do those mistakes again. So, I'll speak with the team."
            But following discussions between Leclerc and Ferrari to explain the situation, and why his request was refused, it has emerged that the Monegasque driver quickly changed his tune over what happened.
            Having had the reasoning behind Ferrari's decision explained to him, amid the rapidly changing conditions, Leclerc quickly understood that the pitwall had made the right call and it was not the tyre choice that dumped him out as many other teams did exactly the same thing.
            Team principal Fred Vasseur insisted that the situation behind closed doors was very different to how things had appeared when Leclerc first got out of the car as he did not understand the factors that were at play.

            Speaking to selected media, including Motorsport.com, about the events, Vasseur said: "We had a good discussion, and he [Leclerc] said: 'Okay I was wrong.'
            "You know that I'm always trying to protect my guys - the drivers - for the team. I can perfectly understand when they jump out of the car after bad results, and they have the question from someone: were you happy with this strategy? For sure they say no.

            "You will never find drivers say: 'Yeah, it was super, I'm f****d, but it was super.'
            "The most important is that I think sometimes it's better to speak with the team before. It is what we had [after qualifying]. It was very calm, very constructive, and very direct."
            Vasseur said Ferrari's analysis of qualifying showed that its tyre decision was not the key factor to it getting knocked out, as the majority of other cars conducted exactly the same strategy as his squad.
            "We had the same strategy as 90% of the cars, so it was more that Charles was a bit upset with the car," he said.
